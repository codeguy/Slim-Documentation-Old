## Translations

### Get Started

We need translators! Read the instructions below to begin your translation. Please let me know in advance
if you are interested in creating a translation so that you do not duplicate an existing translation. I will
list translations here as they become available.

To start a translation:

1. Fork this repository;
2. Send me your name, language, and GitHub repository fork URL;
2. Translate your GitHub repository fork;
3. Send me a message when your translation is complete;

### What to Translate

Translate the content of each Markdown file, including the YAML front-matter
`title` attribute. **Do not** translate folder or file names.
