title: Route Parameters

You can embed parameters into route resource URIs. In this example, I have two parameters in my
route URI, “:one” and “:two”.

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim();
    $app->get('/books/:one/:two', function ($one, $two) {
        echo "The first paramter is " . $one;
        echo "The second parameter is " . $two;
    });

To create a URL parameter, prepend “:” to the parameter name in the route URI pattern. When the route matches the
current HTTP request, the values for each route parameter are extracted from the HTTP request URI and are passed
into the associated callback function in order of appearance.

### Wildcard route parameters

You may also use wildcard route parameters. These will capture one or many URI segments that correspond to the route
pattern’s wildcard parameter into an array. A wildcard parameter is identified by a “+” suffix; it otherwise acts
the same as normal route parameters shown above. Here’s an example:

    <?php
    $app = new \Slim\Slim();
    $app->get('/hello/:name+', function ($name) {
        // Do something
    });

When you invoke this example application with a resource URI “/hello/Josh/T/Lockhart”, the route callback’s `$name`
argument will be equal to `array('Josh', 'T', Lockhart')`.

### Optional route parameters

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Heads Up!</strong> Optional route segments are experimental. They should only be used
    in the manner demonstrated below.
</div>

You may also have optional route parameters. These are ideal for using one route for a blog archive. To declare
optional route parameters, specify your route pattern like this:

    <?php
    $app = new Slim();
    $app->get('/archive(/:year(/:month(/:day)))', function ($year = 2010, $month = 12, $day = 05) {
        echo sprintf('%s-%s-%s', $year, $month, $day);
    });

Each subsequent route segment is optional. This route will accept HTTP requests for:

* /archive
* /archive/2010
* /archive/2010/12
* /archive/2010/12/05

If an optional route segment is omitted from the HTTP request, the default values in the callback signature are
used instead.

Currently, you can only use optional route segments in situations like the example above where each route segment is
subsequently optional. You may find this feature unstable when used in scenarios different from the example above.
